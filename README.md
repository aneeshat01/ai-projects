# Artificial Intelligence Projects
This repository contains projects I have completed for my Intro to AI course. They showcase my knowledge of the various algorithms used by AI agents to make decisions. In
each project, I have translated psuedocode for these algorithms to python code. These projects have helped me visualize the differences between each algorithm in terms of efficiency and accuracy. You can find more detailed descriptions of each project below.
