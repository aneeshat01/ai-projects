# Artificial Intelligence Projects
This repository contains projects I have completed for my Intro to AI course. They showcase my knowledge of the various algorithms used by AI agents to make decisions. In each project, I have translated psuedocode for these algorithms to Python code. These projects have helped me visualize the differences between each algorithm in terms of efficiency and accuracy. You can find more detailed descriptions of each project below.

# Project 1- Search
Modelled a self-playing Pacman game using various search algorithms. Implemented depth first, breadth first, A*, and uniform cost search using Pacman as a search agent. These searches allow Pacman to make decisions about how to travel through the maze. Also implemented a heuristic to represent eaten/uneaten food pellets (white dots) and the corners of the Pacman maze.

# Project 2- Multi-agent Search
Implemented agents for Pacman and ghosts. Implemented Pacman as a reflex agent, which chooses actions based on its current situation. Also implemented minimax and expectimax algorithms as well as an evaluation function for Pacman and ghost agents to use to make decisions.
